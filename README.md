# GEO5017_assignment1
Performing Polynomial Regression on Estimated Drone Positions

The code contains four python files, namely; main.py, leastsquares.py, gradient_solver.py & plotting.py.

All four are needed to run the main.py, but the program can be run from main.py alone.

In the main.py you can change the following variables to run the program how it is preferred.
- line 22: input data

for the constant velocity gradient descent solver:
- line 37: set learning rate
- line 38: set number of iterations
- line 39: set the tolerance value

for the constant acceleration gradient descent solver:
- line 69: set learning rate
- line 70: set number of iterations
- line 71: set the tolerance value
